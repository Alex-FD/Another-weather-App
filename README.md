# Another-weather-App
This is another weather App based on OpenWeatherMap data. Beautiful design, adaptive (of course) with cool icons (from weather icons) on board.
I also managed to design 2 custom functions. The first one integrates detection of wind direction with roatation of the compass. This feature looks cool.
The second function helps to calculate and set the reduction coefficient of the wind turbine depending on the speed of wind. This feature helps to sync
the rotation of wind turbine blades with wind speed.
